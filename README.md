# StocksSummary
As part of my investment hobby, I have decided to create this quick and easy-to-use summary for stocks based on stock tickers as input. <br />
This is a web scraping on tipranks.com and ycharts.com using JSoup. <br />
Currently presenting the following information: <br />
PE ratio <br />
EPS (earning per share) <br />
EPS change from last year <br />
EBITDA <br />
EBITDA change from last year <br />

Please send me a message for other information that you think could be useful to present.
